Learning Goals
Billboard Magazine puts out a top 100 list of "singles" every year. In the previous homework, you scraped and created a dataframe with columns year, songs, ranking, artists, genres, etc. from this data.
This homework consists of two main parts. 
In the first part of this homework, you will be performing Exploratory Data Analysis on the same dataframe you created last homework.
Billboard Magazine also puts out a top 100 list of "singles" every week.
In the second part of this homework, you will have to scrape Billboard's weekly top 100 list to try to understand how the public's taste in music has evolved. You will do this by learning about the best singers and groups from each year as determined by the Billboard top 100 charts.
The homework will help develop your skills in:
Simple Exploratory Data Analysis
Thinking about data and what features might be used to make predictions
